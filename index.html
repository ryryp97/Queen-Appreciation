    <h2>Band History</h2>

    <p>
        Queen is a rock band that was formed in 1970 in Britain with its core members

        John Deacon as the bassist, and Brian May as the guitarist.

    <p>
        Early in their career, Queen was often influenced by progressive and hard rock,
        however they began gradually adopting more conventional sounds and developing more "radio-friendly" works by incorporating
        elements of pop rock.  This lead the band to great success as their record sales are estimated to be between 170 to 300 million
        which makes them one of the best selling musical artists in the world.
